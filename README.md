## Project Overview

The Ultimate Joke Generator is a single-page web application that allows users to:
- Fetch random jokes from an external API
- Toggle between light and dark themes
- Save jokes locally using browser storage
- Enjoy a dynamic animated background for improved user experience

This project focuses on **clarity, simplicity, and clean client-side logic** rather than over-engineering.

## System Analysis Perspective

From a system analysis standpoint, the application consists of:

- **Presentation Layer:**  
  HTML + CSS for structure and styling, including responsive design and dark mode.

- **Logic Layer:**  
  JavaScript handles API requests, DOM updates, theme toggling, and local storage.

- **External Services:**  
  - JokeAPI for content delivery  
  - Particles.js for animated background effects

No backend or database is required, making the system easy to deploy and maintain.
